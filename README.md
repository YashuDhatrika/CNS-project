Project Aims and Objectives
Our first objective is to examine the implications of the opioid crisis on hiring 
and training by 1) understanding the levels of hiring and educational pipeline building in areas that are hard hit by 
the opioid epidemic, using data from 2010-current. We examine these implicationsin the context of all sector jobs, 
as well as the health care workforce in particular,focusing on the SUDS treatment-capable workforce. Our second object is 
to examinethe causal effects of policies that aim to encourage treatment, through past Medicaid expansionpolicy, and as federal, 
state and local billsadvance rapidly; our access to close-to-real-time educational data and unique real-time nationwide data at the
local level on hiring is aparticularly important for generating statistical evidence and visualizations that will 
impact policy and practice.
